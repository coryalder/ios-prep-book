# Assignment 2: Guess the number

##### Switch case

```c
int mystery_number = 7;
int number_chosen;

printf("Win a prize everytime!\n");
printf("\n";
printf("Pick a number between: 1 - 5\n");
scanf("%d\n", &number_chosen); // 5
printf("Congratulations! You won a...\n");

switch(number_chosen)
{
  case 1: printf("Trip to Barbados!"); break;
  case 2: printf("A bicycle!"); break;
  case 3: printf("A meal at Timmies!"); break;
  case 4: printf("Season pass to Wonderland!"); break;
  case 5: printf("Five nights at DisneyLand!"); break;
}
```

**Rules**
- prompts the user to pick one
- If the user guesses your secret number print “You guessed my number!” to the screen.
- If the user does not guess your secret number in 3 guesses, print “Uh oh, you lose!” to the screen and stop execution of the program.

**Tips**
- loop required

**Notes**
- Create this as a new project in Xcode.
