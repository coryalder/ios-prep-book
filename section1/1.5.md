# Decision Making

Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.

Show below is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in C.

##### if
```c
int target = 10;
if (target == 10) {
    printf("Target is equal to 10");
}
```
> Target is equal to 10


##### if...else
```c
int target = 3;
if (target > 5) {
  printf("Target is greater than 5")
} else {
  printf("Target is less than 5")
}
```
> Target is less than 5


##### Nesting if...else
```c
int peanuts_eaten = 22;
int peanuts_in_jar = 100;
int max_peanut_limit = 50;

if (peanuts_in_jar > 80)
{
  if (peanuts_eaten < max_peanut_limit)
  {
    printf("Take as many peanuts as you want!\n", );
  }
}
else
{
  if (peanuts_eaten > peanuts_in_jar)
  {
    printf("You can't have anymore peanuts!\n", );
  }
  else
  {
    printf("Alright, just one more peanut.\n", );
  }
}
```
> Take as many peanuts as you want!

##### Switch case

```c
int mystery_number = 7;
int number_chosen;

printf("Win a prize everytime!\n");
printf("\n";
printf("Pick a number between: 1 - 5\n");
scanf("%d\n", &number_chosen); // 5
printf("Congratulations! You won a...\n");

switch(number_chosen)
{
  case 1: printf("Trip to Barbados!"); break;
  case 2: printf("A bicycle!"); break;
  case 3: printf("A meal at Timmies!"); break;
  case 4: printf("Season pass to Wonderland!"); break;
  case 5: printf("Five nights at DisneyLand!"); break;
}
```
> Five nights at DisneyLand!
