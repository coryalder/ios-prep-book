# Introduction to Programming C
###### Estimated time for completion: 10 hours

### Introduction
iOS applications are written in Objective-C (as well as the newly introduced Swift, which we will cover later in the course). Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language built on top of the C programming language. We are going to learn the fundamentals of C in this section and then move on to Objective-C in the next section.

### C
C is an efficient and relatively small programming language. In other words, you don't have to learn many *commands* in C. Throughout this section, you will learn about C commands. and other elements of the C language, such as operators, functions and preprocessor directives.

Letâ€™s write our first C program!

### A Few Key Points To Remember
* Mac OS X comes with a C compiler
* We have all the tools we need to learn the C Programming language
* Don't worry that C might be a little confusing. This section will break down C concepts into easily digestible bits. With practice, you will do just fine!
