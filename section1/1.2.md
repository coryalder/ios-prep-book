# Clarifying your code with Comments

Your computer must be able to understand your programs. Because the computer is a dumb machine, you must be careful to spell C commends exactly right and type them in the order you want them executed. However, people also read your programs.

You must ensure that your programs are understandable to people as well as computers. Therefore, you should document your programs by explaining what they do.
