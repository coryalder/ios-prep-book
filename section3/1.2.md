# Git basics
---

Make sure you are in Terminal when following the steps below

#### Create a new repository
Create a new directory `mkdir` and or  `cd` change into one of the directories where you did your assignments

`git init`

to create a new git repository.

#### Add & Commit your files
You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using

*For single files*
```
git add <filename>
```

*All files*
```
git add .
```

This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use

`git commit -m "Commit message"`

Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

#### Pushing changes
Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute

```
git push origin master
```

Change master to whatever branch you want to push your changes to.
